Meritum I made by MERA ELZAB in Zabrze was a clone of TRS-80. It had three issues ( MERITUM I / MERITUM I v. 2 or MERITUM II / MERITUM III only in trial series).
I have MERITUM I v. 1, the earliest model, without FDC connector and polish letters on keyboard.
My unit is from 1984 and has a S/N of 314.
